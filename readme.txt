Secure temporary admin access for WordPress support engineers. Generate OTP-based access without sharing passwords.

== Description ==

HappyAccess simplifies the process of granting **temporary admin access** to support engineers, developers, and agencies - securely, transparently, and GDPR-compliantly.

It removes the need for merchants to manually create/delete admin users or share passwords, while maintaining full control and audit visibility.

= Key Features =

* **üîê OTP-Based Authentication** - Generate secure 6-digit codes instead of sharing passwords.
* **‚è± Time-Limited Access** - Automatically expires after the set duration (1 hour to 30 days).
* **üßπ Automatic Cleanup** - Temporary users are deleted automatically when access expires.
* **üìù Full Audit Log** - Track all access and actions with CSV export for compliance.
* **‚úâÔ∏è Email Notifications** - Optionally send access codes to admin email for secure sharing.
* **üö® Emergency Lock** - One-click button to instantly revoke all active tokens.
* **‚úÖ GDPR Compliant** - Built-in consent workflow and data protection features.
* **üé® Native WordPress UI** - Uses WordPress admin styles with helpful tooltips.
* **üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Security** - Rate limiting, IP tracking, and failed attempt lockouts.
* **üìä Active Token Management** - View all active codes, see usage status, and revoke anytime.
